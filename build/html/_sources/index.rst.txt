BlueFridgeNonLin documentation
==============================
Welcome to the BlueFridgeNonLin project. This is the documentation built for the blue fridge non-Hermitian 4+5 qubit setup when we are still using gpib and the wx.
We are using the `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ documentation tool to build this documentation. This is our first step towards 
object orientation and modularization of the code for multi qubit experiments. We are aiming to use qubit and gate objects to ensure
that the code will be maintable, scalable to other experimental setups, and consistent across different experiments.
